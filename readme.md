README for hangman Python CLI game

Hangman CLI Game made with Python made to practice some of the features of python

The game starts immediately you run the file and it basically asks for a letter that is in a six-lettered word and the player has to keep guessing until the letters are figured out or the player is out of guesses. The player has 6 attempts at guessing the wrong letter before the losing the round.
The csv file contains words with more than 6 letters but I narrowed it down for ease and consitency


PS. I'm new to programming and this is my first time of writing a readme so bear with me.
